Truth be told, I would have posted this the week before ast, but there were a few things I needed to do so it could be the way I wanted it...mainly, I wanted to make a Portuguese translation before I posted it. There's two reasons for this: 1) the process of translation is good for thinking about the content and 2) I like having more content available for my Brazilian friends as well as the rest. :)

Most of my life for the last week has been about vision.

Finals came and went - studying for them was a rigorous adaptation to my schedule. It's for this reason that I didn't get to posting something for y'all for last week. I was able to not only hit my goal for grades, but exceed them. I've done better than I ever have in my life academically! I'm so happy with how this semester has turned out!...so naturally, next semester's going to be even harder. *Uuuuuggghh....*

This last Friday after exams I was the recipient of [LASIK surgery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK). It's a corrective surgery that eliminates the need for glasses or contacts, which I've always had - my vision has always been terribly nearsighted. I was so excited to have the opportunity to receive it! It was a very fast procedure, and the recovery time is relatively short. This made Christmas break a suitable time to get it, and I'm really glad I did. I can see everything without having to worry about maintenance of glasses or contacts! My own eyes can now focus clearly on things I couldn't see before. My perspective without glasses was so limited, and until now I've simply dealt with it. But no more! Muahahaha!

Recently I've been pondering a lot about the limited spiritual perspective that I have. When I say this, I mean it in a lot of ways - seeing myself, seeing others, seeing what it is I can and should change in order to do things the way the Lord expects me to. I think the Christmas is a time where many are reflective about these changes, like I've mentioned in my [previous spiritual post](/spiritual/2014/12/07/his-gifts-are-many/). I've actually been reading a lot lately about just how limited our spiritual vision is, and [how we are expected to behave with it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDEXQ-GTYTs).

In direct relation to this, there's a lot of things I think I'm still studying forensically about my mission lifestyle. I didn't realize it at the time, but there was a lot of small mechanisms that truly [enforced doing things in order](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.27?lang=eng#26), which was when I felt I was able to see things the most clearly in spiritual terms. There was always study time. There was always time for meditation. Due to the nature of missionary work, there were natural breaks that made it so that in general my companion and I adequately rested and exercised mentally and physically between appointments.

It's so tempting not to do anything like what I've described above! I've always felt a constant pressure to get up and just start doing things nonstop from when I wake up until the moment I lay down to sleep. My limited experience from my mission and in my life now has taught me that this is often at odds with doing what is actually important. That time to pause and think was essential for our being able to do things to the best of our ability. Otherwise, we wouldn't have the Spirit with us. Without it, it would have been harder to teach lessons, to find people who wanted to join the Church, and to feel like we were truly being guided. By taking more time to do things...we were actually more productive, and more edified by the work we did and its results.

The only effective way to have study and meditation time, I've found, is to make time at the sacrifice of other things I may want to do or feel the need to get done. I actually have to say "no" to things that I may want to actually get done so that I can attend to these habits. This might sound a little counter-intuitive...but I've had some time to prove these findings!

I've noticed that when I do those simple things, not only does my daily satisfaction in what I have done increase, but also the assurance I feel throughout the day that I am doing what is right likewise increases. [Paul described our experience in this life as a dark glass](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.12?lang=eng#11), or mirror, through which it is difficult to see things as the really are. I feel distinctly that the glass through which I see things is brightened when I do what I've described, at least temporarily; I am given the vision I need to do that which is most important in the moment. I think that the simple acts of prayer, study, and planning is what makes it so that I focus on what's important, and not on what's urgent. This doesn't mean every single day has to be perfect, but when I have the time to do as I've described I can't feel satisfied with doing it any other way now.

There is no LASIK surgery for our spiritual eyes - at least, not in this life. And yet, we all *chose* to darken our own spiritual vision (see [here](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/veil?lang=eng), definition 4) so that we would learn how to walk the next few steps we need without knowing everything in advance. Knowing that kind of puts things into a different perspective, doesn't it? I think we wonder sometimes why there's no one-time spiritual surgery that lets us see everything clearly, so that we can know the way. But we actually chose to be spiritually myopic for now, so that we could develop in ourselves something even more important! Keeping the right perspective is what will help us to have the desire to push forward, come what may! Unfortunately, my time for this post has run short...so I'll just finish by posting some (hopefully) relevant study material from my studies the week before last:

* Enos showed us how he walked step by step in the fog of the dark glass of our mortal life. He was uncertain as to his desires, as described in his ["wrestle before God"](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.1-2?lang=eng#1). He prayed for divine help as he [sought a clearer understanding of his desires](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/8.24-26?lang=eng#23).
* Elder Bednar talked about the importance of faith in the face of a particularly dark glass in a Mormon Message called ["Patterns of Light: Spirit of Revelation"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slTa15a3mp0).
* President Uchtdorf speaks in [his October 2011 General Conference address](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/10/you-matter-to-him?lang=eng) about what we need to remember in the context of our relationship with Heavenly Father when dealing with a dark glass:

    > My dear brothers and sisters, it may be true that man is nothing in comparison to the greatness of the universe. At times we may even feel insignificant, invisible, alone, or forgotten. But always remember â€” you matter to Him! If you ever doubt that, consider [this]...[W]hat you see and experience now is not what forever will be. You will not feel loneliness, sorrow, pain, or discouragement forever. We have the faithful promise of God that He will neither forget nor forsake those who incline their hearts to Him. Have hope and faith in that promise. Learn to love your Heavenly Father and become His disciple in word and in deed.

That's it for me this week. My eyes are telling me that it's time to take a serious nap...I hope you had a wonderful Christmas, everybody! I look forward to your responses. :)
