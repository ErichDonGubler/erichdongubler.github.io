Well, there's *a lot of stuff* that I learned last week and the week before. I touched many times on a specific principle, and that facilitates my writing processing quite a bit for this post. To that end, I have a question for you:

Do you know how bamboo grows?

Bamboo, as some know, is reaaaally tall! Did you know that most of its growth that we see only happens over 60 days? [Bamboo is notable for growing so fast] [source]...but the interesting thing about bamboo is that what takes the most time in its growth is that of its *root*. Something that many don't know is that the individual columsn are actually the same plant - they have the same root! But now all of the bamboo shoots appear at the same time. The speed of that growth depends heavily on the conditions of the root. If the right conditions are present, on average a shoot can grow *1.2-3.9 inches per day* - if they're not present, then it that could be halved. All this speed can only be seen after the column sprouts from the root! Normally what happens is that bamboo is distributed in pieces of the root. Once the root is planted, it takes more or less **3 years** for many new shoots to grow.

All this time is dedicated just to establish the shoots' foundation! When they're ready, they grow extremely fast - over 60 days, as said before, and then the new growth goes towards the new shoots. The old shoots are what provide the energy for the new ones. We see that this foundation and its establishment are essenetial for the life of the bamboo plant.

It's the same with us! Many times, we think about seeing immediate results in our progress, and about changing who we are quickly when we have a goal to change. It's true that many great things can happen in our lives - there are certain times when many things change, like a full-time mission, marriage, having a new child in the family, or having a death in the family. But most of the changes that happen in us are at the root, growing without being seen or noticed. We are prepared little by little for the great changes, and I was able to learn a lot about that this last week. One of the projects I am doing at college, for instance, is a long-term project that serves as the capstone for the Bachelors degree in my major here. It's a complicated project, and it takes 2 entire semesters to complete it. I'm now in the second semester of it, and I have a much more complete understanding of the project itself and how it will be realized than before. It's big, and it's quite complicated!  But it's composed of many small parts that work together which I spent most of my major studying. It's only recently that I discovered that I can describe how it works to friends that haven't gotten to starting this project yet! After spending so much time establishing a firm foundation of education in my major, I was able to see a visible sign of growth! Now I can see some of the results of the steady accumulation of small and simple things. It's satisfying to see the surprise that people - potential employers - express when I actually describe to them the project.

That surprise reminds me of that which I saw in others that were not part of the Church when I served a full-time mission in Brazil. The standards of the Church always called their attention. For instance, it's a considered a basic (but essential) choice to avoid harmful substances for our bodies advised in the Word of Wisdom, and to maintain sexual purity by obeying the Law of Chastity. We got many questions like these:

* "You don't smoke or drink? What do you mean???"
* "You don't earn money for your service here? How do you pay the bills then?"
* "How can you stand to be away from your family for so long?"

Have you ever heard someone else's admiration for your lifestyle because of such fundamental things that you didn't know how to respond? These are the [small and simple things] [alma] that Alma identified for his son...as he asked for the plates of the record that became the Book of Mormon to be cleaned and maintained to retain their brightness. All of these laws of the gospel build us up to be worthy of greater things, like temple marriage and the vicarious work of bringing salvation to our ancestors who did not have the opportunity to accept saving ordinances. They are all possible because of the strong roots that the basis of the gospel helps us to build! All of the small and simple things add up into things that people who don't even know us notice! The irony of that is that we don't notice many times until we look back, and take the time to recognize the changes that have happened in us.

My gratitude has been increased this week by learning this lesson. We need to see the small individual roots of the many that lend strength to us! Each thing we have in our lives has a basis in something that came before. My family is part of the Church because of the foundation that was established some generations before us, when an ancestor called [Wandle Mace] [wandle] was dissatisfied with the lack of answers to the questions he had about his relationship with God and about the authority of the priesthood mentioned in the Bible. Many things were built upon this foundation afterwards - almost all of my recent ancestors were a part of and served in the Church, thus establishing a rich inheritance of raising the family through the gospel. Becase of this, many of the things I know now were taught to me in my family, and without them I could only say that I would be a less happy person that I am today. They are the foundation of what I do every day, and of my goals and expectations for the future. These are no small things for me! All of this because of a small decision of my ancestor deciding to ask a few questions about the Bible!

I am grateful for my roots, as much for the ones that have come before me as the ones established in my personal life now. I am grateful for how they have made possible who I am today and being able to live within the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. I know of the reality of His suffering in order to create a strong root for happiness in this life and in the life to come. I am grateful for the essential foundation that He left with us, and that He brought back once again after being lost through the prophet Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon. These facts bring me more happiness and comfort than any other thing in my life.

I love you! Don't forget to write back!
