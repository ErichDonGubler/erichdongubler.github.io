It's been a long time since I've written a post to my missionary friends, but recently the departure of a brother-in-law made me realize that I missed them. I'd really like to do them again. I posted so many times back in the day that it almost seems more difficult to dust off the pen and the keyboard. I hope I'm not too rusty bearing my testimony to you. :)

Most of you reading this have never received a missionary post from me. Those of you that do know that my primary motivation for sending them is twofold:

1. I love studying and thinking enough about the Gospel to give a (brief) thought and testimony with which I hope to strengthen missionaries, some of the strongest people on this earth in spirituals terms.
2. While missionaries are, without a doubt, blessed constantly with gifts to help them in ways they've never been blessed before, they still need to be remembered. I want you to know that I remember you and want you to know what's going on over here.

That said, I know that missionary time is precious and short. First, let's give you an update that will bring you up to speed as my friends! Last time I sent a new post, I'd just barely started getting to know the marvelous individual who would become my wife in less than 6 months. Life has been quite busy since then!

Isn't she lovely? That's Paige -- a wonderful source of sunshine in my life. I now live with her in Lindon, and am happier than I've ever been. In addition to getting married to Paige and her incredible family, I also graduated from UVU with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I got a full-time job at a place called Xima Software:

Ximaâ€™s located in South Jordan, and we'll be moving to Midvale close by soon. We're excited for this new chapter in our lives!

That's a lot to of condensed history, but time is short! I still have to tell you the most important part of my post!

All I want to tell you today just how much being a missionary blessed my life. 

When I was a wee lad pre-mission, I thought my life was dandy. I didn't have much to complain about (though I surely did), and had grown up my entire life within a strong family that tried their best to lead me to things that would make me happy. For the most part, they succeeded -- I was able to complete my Associates degree and my high school diploma at the age of 17, with some very employable skills developed in computer science. My moral values were fairly well-developed, and I essentially understood what I felt would make me happy. I did not live everything to its fullest, however -- there were some commandments I wasn't keeping, and didn't truly understand that I was suffering for them. After graduation, I spent a year working and studying some more and readied myself to go on a mission. Most of this preparation was mental, steeling myself to go on something I saw an an opportunity to be better for myself and for those I loved.

Starting from the point I entered the MTC, I realized that I was happier than I had ever been. I was able to do things because I wanted to do them, and it just so happened that I wanted to do the best I could as a missionary. I was able to apply my agency in a way I never had before, and I was so grateful that I could finally spread my own wings. I looked forward to entering the field with great anticipation.

When I got on my mission, it was the hardest thing I ever did. I was confronted with many challenges to my own personality and a certain blindness I had to some essential social skills, along with the same commandments with which I had struggled. Still, I held fast, and knew that what I was doing was far more important than any of the challenges I was experiencing at that time. The only reason I knew that was because I had begun to really pay attention to my relationship with my Heavenly Father, and He strengthened me to overcome the challenges that came my way. I had never realized just how much effort was necessary to have that relationship with anybody, my own family included. I discovered and richness and strength of life I'd never known before. I began to understand that I had been missing out on something I never wanted to let go: the purpose and joy of living the Gospel to its fullest.

I would like to suggest that missions are a sort of acid test. Have you ever heard of an acid test before? In English, we use it as an expression indicating that the "acid test" is something that will determine the character of a person or thing. They're used to prove the purity of gold, by dropping acids in stronger and stronger measures that will dissolve mixtures with increasingly higher proportions of gold, which resist the acid. Once you find the strength of acid that finally dissolves what you are testing, you know exactly how much of it is actually gold.

As I worked with Heavenly Father to be better on my mission, I slowly began to be purified. My mission was my acid test, slowly burning away impurities inside me that I think we all have. I had no idea how much those impurities held me back until He applied the many demands a successful mission requires, and I let him take them away. It wasn't ever easy -- I had spent my entire life thinking that the impurities I carried with me were an intergral part of who I was, and that letting them go meant losing a part of myself. I learned the truth of the [Lord's words when He walked with the Jews](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/16.25?lang=eng#24):

> 24 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
> 
> 25 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.
> 
> 26 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

Life is an acid test. You will see what you are made of as you allow Heavenly Father to burn away the impurities in you. I know this is true, because He has helped me so much Himself to be better and more adequate for the tasks He has given me my entire life. And I never, ever want to part with the knowledge of knowing that I am actually made of some pretty precious stuff.
