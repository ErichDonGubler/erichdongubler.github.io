title: Balancing the Rescue and Homework
---
This week before last was an interesting set of adjustments.

I had a somewhat imbalanced week. From the first day of each class I got a new assignment/project, and it frankly kind of panicked me. I spent a TON of time getting projects out of the way, and now I'm in something of an assignment vacuum. That's never really happened before...and now I wish I'd taken the time to take care of physical and social needs better.

Live and learn, I suppose. I'm glad to know that I can actually see myself handling the increased load for this semester. This last week, I spent much, much more time trying to attend to my own needs and the needs of people around me, instead of panicking for the sheer amount of homework I thought I had.

This week, I'm just grateful I felt good enough - at peace enough with myself - to be able to put out this blog post. I actually have to prepare myself intelectually and spiritually for this. I make a goal of it every week, because if I do it means I feel like I've fed myself well enough spiritually that I can share with others. What better way to help out people I love than sending something uplifting, and letting them know that I remember them? :)

In [Alma 12:22-34](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.22-34?lang=eng#21), we learn some interesting points about the role of angels:

> Now we see that Adam did fall by the partaking of the forbidden fruit, according to the word of God; and thus we see, that by his fall, all mankind became a lost and fallen people.
> 
> . . . .
> 
> And we see that death comes upon mankind, yea, the death which has been spoken of by Amulek, which is the temporal death; nevertheless there was a space granted unto man in which he might repent; therefore this life became a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for that endless state which has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection of the dead.
> 
> Now, if it had not been for the plan of redemption, which was laid from the foundation of the world, there could have been no resurrection of the dead; but there was a plan of redemption laid, which shall bring to pass the resurrection of the dead[.]
> 
> . . . .
> 
> But behold, it was not so; but it was appointed unto men that they must die; and after death, they must come to judgment, even that same judgment of which we have spoken, which is the end.
> 
> . . . .
> 
> And after God had appointed that these things should come unto man, behold, then he saw that it was expedient that man should know concerning the things whereof he had appointed unto them;
> 
> Therefore he sent angels to converse with them, who caused men to behold of his glory.

This post is about angels. I've been thinking a lot lately about my relationship with Heavenly Father, and how patiently and frequently He sends angels my way to help me with what I need. Two interesting questions that my mission president, President Gonzaga, always said were important to distinguish are "Why?" and "What for?". Both are important - and many times the answers are very, very different when we ask them about spiritual things. The second is answered with the remainder of the passage from Alma:

> And they began from that time forth to call on his name; therefore God conversed with men, and made known unto them the plan of redemption, which had been prepared from the foundation of the world; and this he made known unto them according to their faith and repentance and their holy works.
> 
> . . . .
> 
> Therefore God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto them the plan of redemption, that they should not do evil . . . . saying: If ye will repent, and harden not your hearts, then will I have mercy upon you, through mine Only Begotten Son; Therefore, whosoever repenteth, and hardeneth not his heart, he shall have claim on mercy through mine Only Begotten Son, unto a remission of his sins; and these shall enter into my rest.

Angels, like most other things that the Lord has given us, are messengers and reminders. Messengers help us to build our knowledge of what is right, and by so doing increase our capacity to do the Lord's will. They bring good tidings, and provide us with the assistance we need to return to live with Him. Reminders are what the Lord uses when we already have everything we need to do what is next for us. 

Many think of heavenly beings when the word "angel" is mentioned. But there are also mortal angels upon whom God depends to help His children become worthy and ready to live with Him again. Many of you have been those ministering spirits for me. I am happy to have the privilege to say that for two years as a full-time missionary my role was to do my best to represent the Lord in what is essentially the function of an angel. We become angels by heeding the ones that God sends to us. We are not perfect, and sometimes our errands will not be completed perfectly. Nevertheless, He trusts us and shows His love for us when we are called to be His angels in our families and in our callings.

I can say with confidence that my relationship with Heavenly Father has improved this last week as I have tried harder to do better in [small, simple things](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.6-7?lang=eng#5) through the angelic reminders He has sent me. I started making goals to actually plan *less* during the day because I felt that I needed to dedicate more time to the reminders He has sent me. It's been interesting to see the result. It's been easier to exercise, easier to pay attention to others' needs, easier to spend time with my family and take care of what I consider to be important...and you know, my capacity to study and to get my assignments done for college have seemed to come more easily, despite having spent less time studying. Knowing and thinking about how Heavenly Father does so much for me really makes me want to give back. I can't help but think of [what the Savior said](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/18.11-14?lang=eng#10) about how He values myself and the people around me (emphasis added):

>  For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
>  How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?
>  And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.
>  **Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.**

This is the answer to the "why" of the ministering work of angels. God doesn't want to lose a single person, a single one of His lambs whom He cares for and preoccupies Himself with. Even when I make mistakes, the Lord will come to rescue me should I be unable to help myself, and to remind me of Himself when I *am* able to help myself. The same goes for you, and for the people that He has put in your path! You are the means by which He makes the rescue, and gives others the support necessary to stay on the path to eternal life. Do we really realize just how important the small things we do to lift people up are? Are we thinking about how and to whom we can do them? Are we asking for opportunities to serve every day? If not, then let's accept Elder Ballard's suggestion from his [October 2012 Conference address](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/be-anxiously-engaged.p31-35?lang=eng#f1), and do so!

It is my prayer that we can do this, and understand more fully through the Holy Ghost the love the Lord has for us as His children...and the only good way I've found to do it is to actually follow up on E. Ballard's challenge, and think about it constantly. I'm not perfect, but after last week's experiences I know that this is true. Get out there! Go bless somebody's life! And don't be afraid to reply with your stories and comments. ;)

I love y'all! Don't forget to write!
