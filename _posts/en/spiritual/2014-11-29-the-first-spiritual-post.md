Whoo! This is the first post that I'm publishing with a new blog system! I'm excited to be able to focus more on writing what I want to write, instead of of getting buried in details of formatting, like with the last blog. I explain it better in [another post](/2014/11/composition-and-digitizing) why I made a new blog, and why it's better for my needs.

It's been so good to be on the Thanksgiving holiday! It was great to be able to renew family bonds, not just with relatives but also with the family I live with every day. I was able to spend a lot of time with my parents, and I'm grateful for that. They've guided me to things that give my so much joy today. Being a part of the Church, serving a full-time mission in it, having a good education as much familial as academic, being taught to love and to try to do good in the lives of other people...these are things that my parents have tried to teach me, and it must have had some effect, because I notice that they're an almost exclusive source of happiness for my life. I owe a lot to them, and to their efforts to raise me as a good person. Truly families are very important.

I have been able to learn a lot last week about enduring to the end. I focused on General Conference talks because Institute doesn't move forward with its curriculum during the Thanksgiving holiday. I was edified, and taught what I feel is exactly what I need to know now. Let's make a list of the talks that stood out most:

* ["You Know Enough"](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/10/you-know-enough?lang=eng), E. Anderson, October 2008 GC. This is a wonderful talk!
* ["Desire"](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/04/desire?lang=eng), E. Oaks, April 2011 GC. This helped a lot to understand how I can make better decisions, starting very small.
* ["Sacrament Meeting and the Sacrament"](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/10/sacrament-meeting-and-the-sacrament?lang=eng), E. Oaks, October 2008 GC. I understood a lot better how to treat the sacrament in my life - this is probably something we all need to be reminded of every once in a while.

I keep a list of "core documents" which I consider important enough to make a small curriculum out of them for my future life. It's not an addition to the standard works of the Church, but they're talks that I think highlight very well the principles taught in them. I consider what I put on that list so important that a sincere desire of mine is to be able to review its items often with my future family, so that they can be strong and have a correct understanding of spiritual reality. I added all of these items from the list above to my list of core documents.

That said, I know I won't have enough time to type everything that I want from these talks, so I'll select just a part from the first talk I listed - "You Know Enough" is a single-phrase sermon! The stories that E. Andersen told in that talk were powerful, and I'd like to cite one of them:

> Brothers and sisters, we each have moments of spiritual power, moments of inspiration and revelation. We must sink them deep into the chambers of our souls. As we do, we prepare our spiritual home storage for moments of personal difficulty. Jesus said, “Settle this in your hearts, that ye will do the things which I shall teach, and command you.”
> 
> Several years ago a friend of mine had a young daughter die in a tragic accident. Hopes and dreams were shattered. My friend felt unbearable sorrow. He began to question what he had been taught and what he had taught as a missionary. The mother of my friend wrote me a letter and asked if I would give him a blessing. As I laid my hands upon his head, I felt to tell him something that I had not thought about in exactly the same way before. The impression that came to me was: Faith is not only a feeling; it is a decision. He would need to choose faith.
> 
> My friend did not know everything, but he knew enough. He chose the road of faith and obedience. He got on his knees. His spiritual balance returned.
> 
> It has been several years since that event. A short time ago I received a letter from his son who is now serving a mission. It was full of conviction and testimony. As I read his beautiful letter, I saw how a father’s choice of faith in a very difficult time had deeply blessed the next generation.
> 
> Challenges, difficulties, questions, doubts—these are part of our mortality. But we are not alone. As disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, we have enormous spiritual reservoirs of light and truth available to us. Fear and faith cannot coexist in our hearts at the same time. In our days of difficulty, we choose the road of faith. Jesus said, “Be not afraid, only believe.”
> 
> Through the years we take these important spiritual steps over and over again. We begin to see that “he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.” Our questions and doubts are resolved or become less concerning to us. Our faith becomes simple and pure. We come to know what we already knew.

The sentence ***"Faith is not not only a feeling; it is a decision."*** is one of the most dear things I have heard this last week. Oftimes, I think that we act to follow the path of least resistance. I even think that most of the time the decision is good, but in the end we take it because it's easy to take. I learned with my studies this week a little about what the difference is between the natural man and the spiritual man. Many times, people make a decision because their situation impels them to take it. However, truly spiritual decisions are the result of consideration and action - these are active things! Many of the challenges that we have are experiences that make us do these two things more than normally. I think of the challenges in my current life. Having to think more about what to do, the foundational decisions in life - who I'll marry, what I should study, where I should focus my time - is part of that! Being solely responsible for something happening - personal studies, getting good grades in college, being diligent in callings and in taking care of my family - is also part of that! I think that these challenges are to help us to make the decision to have faith, and Heavenly Father gives them to us because He wants to prove who we are and the good we can do.

I would like to express my admiration for the Saints that I knew on my mission who strived to be an active part of the Church, and to be obedient to the high standard that Heavenly Father gave us. Truly the natural man would not have done as they did - they did not act on the influence of the world, but on the influence of what they knew to be right in their heart. They made the decision to have faith, and it strengthened me immensely during my time in Brazil. I continue to see good examples around me everywhere I go that has the Church. I'm grateful to be a part of it, and to have the scriptures and a knowledge that Heavenly Father expects me to share with everyone. I know that Heavenly Father is anxious to be reunited with us, and for that cause He sends so many good things - so that we can live the gospel restored through Joseph Smith, and always be happy.
