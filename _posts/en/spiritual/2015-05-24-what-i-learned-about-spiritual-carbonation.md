title: What I Learned about Spiritual Carbonation
---

I've been working and growing to love new job from the last two weeks. It's been way easier after getting over the initial learning curve of new job, new faces, new products, and starting to feel productive. :) I work now as a qualty assurance intern for the Church in a city called Riverton, which is about 40 minutes from my house by car (with no traffic).

I'm actually moving to Riverton in a bit. Why? Because I'm tired of trading efficiency for energy. See that commute line with transfers from the bus, to the train, and back to the bus, which takes over an hour and a half in the best case? I've been taking that one. Rent is cheaper than a tank of gas every month plus the commute time to me. I should be back in Provo once the internship is over, though -- I may not like the commute to Riverton, but a commute to Orem from Provo with free room and board is still a sweet deal. :)

Anyway. Back to the internship at the Church, a short description of what I do is that I test applications developed by a team that plays the role of a software vendor for the missionary department. My team's purpose is to hasten the missionary work by facilitating missionaries in tasks they commonly carry out. I feel like I'm contributing to the missionary work in a way I never could before! I'm so proud to be able to contribute to something I feel like I would have found useful when I served my mission in Brazil. I'm excited to find ways to make those applications better and give them tools of the quality that is characteristic of the good things Heavenly Father gives so freely.

I've learned a lot about mental discipline this last week. The first and third weeks of work (out of three so far) was all public transportation. Because of other appointments, I made the commute by car for the majority of the second and third week. The difference was very interesting: I feel like I've had a chunk of sanity that's been missing restored. Adding just an extra hour to each day felt very liberating, and for the first time in forever I don't feel so bone-tired! I feel like I have energy to attack tasks I've been wanting to get to in forever. I'm just excited to get over the burnout phase I entered during the semester!

I've also learned a lot about the truth contained in the analogy used by Cheryl A. Esplin in [this year's April conference talk](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/04/filling-our-homes-with-light-and-truth?lang=eng) when comparing our spiritual strength to resist negative influences to two soda cans, one empy and one full, which she had heard from another Young Women's organization leader.

In the explanation of the analogy, our spiritual strength is similar to how a soda can behaves when under pressure:

> The concept of being filled with light and truth became particularly important to me because of an experience I had many years ago. I attended a meeting where members of the Young Women general board taught about creating spiritually strong families and homes. To visually demonstrate this, a Young Women leader held up two soda cans. In one hand she held a can that was empty and in the other hand a can that was unopened and full of soda. First, she squeezed the empty can; it began to bend and then collapsed under the pressure. Next, with her other hand, she squeezed the unopened can. It held firm. It didn’t bend or collapse like the empty can—because it was filled.
>
> We likened this demonstration to our individual lives and to our homes and families. When filled with the Spirit and with gospel truth, we have the power to withstand the outside forces of the world that surround and push against us. However, if we are not filled spiritually, we don’t have the inner strength to resist the outside pressures and can collapse when forces push against us.

A lot of times, I would get so focused on *doing* things -- using the physical, mental, and spiritual strength I constantly receive -- that I would end up a little bit like the empty soda can. Yes, the strength is there; I'm supposed to use it! But learning about my limits was good, because the points I felt like my soda can was a little low on pressure was when things were tough. I have greater power to recognize those limits now, and I hope that I can get out of the habit of being so close to exceeding them now. I have several ideas of changing my lifestyle so that this is possible, but...well, I wouldn't want to give any spoilers! ;)

I'll just close here with a some thoughts I find highly relevant. First is a [scripture from D&C 10](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.4-5?lang=eng#3):

> Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength and means provided to enable you to translate; but be diligent unto the end.

I think the trick to keeping this counsel given, which appears in [other](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.27?lang=eng#26) [places](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ex/18.13-23?lang=eng#12) in scripture as well, is to learn what things really require your time. It's kind of like making a budget with one's money -- with a budget, it's impossible to lie to yourself. You are forced to recognize your limits, and know if you are making a realistic budget or not. As the [Ghost of Christmas Present said](https://www.youtube.com/v/SHfaRVf5cUY?rel=0&start=4516&end=4560&autoplay=1) in the 1970s rendition of *A Christmas Carol*:

> There is never enough time to do or say all the things that we would wish. The thing is to try to do as much as you can in the time that you have. Remember Scrooge, time is short, and suddenly, you're not there any more.

I'm so grateful for the learning I've been able to go through. I hope that I'll be able to apply it as I learn how to handle myself at another job, doing something I consider an excellent use of my time. I want to use it the best I can, so I can make the greatest contribution to work, to the future family I'll have.

How are y'all doing with the new season of the year? I want to know! Don't forget to write! I love to hear from you!
