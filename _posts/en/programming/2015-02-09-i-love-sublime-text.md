I am a huge [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) fan. I use it almost exclusively for development because of how much it's simplified my life as a developer. I've only discovered it in the last 7 months I've been coding, and I'm more than happy to pay for the $70 ticket after doing the ["WinRAR-free"](http://blog.takipi.com/sublime-vs-atom-text-editor-battles/) trial. 

But what features ARE there, anyway? Why on earth should I shell out $70 for another text editor? If I want something fancy, shouldn't I just go with Github's [Atom]()?
