This has been a long time developing, but as I have come to understand the wisdom that Stephen Covey has captured in his book [First Things First](http://???) (which I highly recommend reading!)

## Checklist: What You'll Need

I use the following components/services to implement individual aspects necessary for this time management method:

* **Task management**: keeping your tasks in order is crucial for an effective planning session. This component needs to be something that can do the heavy lifting for sorting and displaying tasks. The bare essentials are:
	* Priority
    * Due date
    * Start date. This will help us resolve "When does something important become urgent?"
    * List/category attributes. Multiple list/category functionality is preferred, as we can use that to our advantage for "concentration" tasks.
    * Task search functionality based upon the above criteria. This will allow us to create views for each quadrant in the Time Management Matrix.

* **Calendar**: The calendar is where you write down your plans, and have a clear guide when you ask yourself: "Am I on track?". Because of how the Covey personal leadership system works, we'll need to indicate to what quadrant our plans belong. When we have that, we'll be able to look at our calendar and at a glance we can tell if and how we can change our plan to respond to inevitable change. The following are important for this tutorial:

    * Multiple calendars
    * Individual calendar colors

You can skip the subsections here if you just want to skip to [getting things set up](## Setup).

### Task management: Remember the Milk

A full task management system like Remember the Milk is awesome because most of the heavy lifting in terms of backend is done for you. It has a powerful search feature, and you can save searches into "smart lists", which allows us to implement the Time Management Matrix very easily. If you have a system that is comparable and can handle the requirements I've listed above, you can probably implement your own version of what I'm going to describe in this tutorial.

Here's how RTM satisfies the requirements above:

* Priority and due date are available.
* Start date was included with RTM's beta that began several months back, and I was lucky enough to be able to experiment with it and develop this process and guide.
* Lists and tags in RTM are extremely flexible.
* RTM's task searching is top-notch, [well-documented](),  and you can save search queries.
* 

### Calendar: Google Calendar

[Google Calendar](calendar.google.com) is pretty standard and has a nice interface, though there are plenty of acceptable alternatives. It implements all of the essential features listed above, which may not sound terribly important now but will make sense in a bit.
