This last week has been an interesting one of reflection, where I've had some time to myself to recover from LASIK surgery and write in my journal. It's been quite the year! And it's been very interesting to think of goals for the next one. [I've done better than I ever have academically](http://i.imgur.com/Fo6TLDI.png), and had the opportunity to do some very interesting research and decision-making. This was simultaneously scary and thrilling! The callings I've had in the Church, both for teaching and for music, have taught me a lot. The friends I've made and the dates I've gone on have helped me to further understand what kind of people I need to surround myself with, and where I need to do better.

##The Theme of People

When I think of this year, I think of you dear friends and members of my family. It's been exactly a month and a week since I made the return trip home from my mission to Brazil, and had to make an adjustment of similar magnitude to when I left. It has been you who have helped me to find lasting value in what I now do as a return missionary! My full-time mission may have ended, but the people from before, during, and after remain, and still have their whole lives to spend along with me.

This year, I was able to learn about what is important.

In [1 Timothy 6](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-tim/6?lang=eng), we are told of what is *not* important. It speaks of servants in the employ of masters that believe in the gospel and those that do not; the latter are described in verses 4-5 as follows:

> He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings...supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself

The verses immediately following make an interesting counterpoint - and connection to E. Ballard's talk - where this great principle is reinforced: 

> But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.

By now, some of you may already have guessed what the most important things in life are...and they're ***people***! There is nothing else which will arrive with us on the other side of the veil, nothing else that was with us before this life, nothing else that brings so much satisfaction and joy as the relationships that we develop and cultivate with others. Godliness, to me, is a word that can be substituted with the phrase "Christlike nature". To be able to be content with being like our Savior is great gain! By imitating his character, we are truly doing what is most important, and will seek to develop the relationships that others need from us and we from them. It is the development of Christlike attributes that is most important, for they will help us to understand what it is we must do, say, and be in order to realize His will...which is that we be happy, and become more like Himself!

A good summary of what I've learned could be expressed in the form of the title of E. Ballard's October 2005 General Conference talk called ["What Matters Most Is What Lasts Longest"](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2005/10/what-matters-most-is-what-lasts-longest?lang=eng). It's a wonderful talk, and I'd recommend you read it. It talks about people! It talks about those closest to us, almost exclusively about family. But that's a different direction that I will go here - there are other things I've studied recently that I would like to share, and then close.

##Going, Doing, and Being

Another big theme I've learned this year actually comes from the beautiful, inspired hymn called "I'll Go Where You Want Me to Go". Let's look at the lyrics (emphasis added by myself):

> It may not be on the mountain height
> Or over the stormy sea,
> It may not be at the battle's front
> My Lord will have need of me.
> But if, by a still, small voice he calls
> To paths that I do not know,
> I'll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in thine:
> **I'll go where you want me to go.**
> 
> ***(Chorus)
> I'll go where you want me to go, dear Lord,
> Over mountain or plain or sea;
> I'll say what you want me to say, dear Lord;
> I'll be what you want me to be.***
> 
> Perhaps today there are loving words
> Which Jesus would have me speak;
> There may be now in the paths of sin
> Some wand'rer whom I should seek.
> O Savior, if thou wilt be my guide,
> Tho dark and rugged the way,
> My voice shall echo the message sweet:
> **I'll say what you want me to say.**
> 
> There's surely somewhere a lowly place
> In earth's harvest fields so wide
> Where I may labor through life's short day
> For Jesus, the Crucified.
> So trusting my all to thy tender care,
> And knowing thou lovest me,
> I'll do thy will with a heart sincere:
> **I'll be what you want me to be.**

I noticed that this song teaches about three basic patterns of choosing the right:

1. **Going**. Going means changing your environment, either by leaving someplace that impedes you from doing what is right, or going someplace that facilitates it. People that have addictions, for instance, are [examples of people that need to *go*](http://www.healthline.com/health/addiction/risk-factors#Genetics2) - they need to control their environment, so that they can bypass influences towards a relapse. Controlling one's environment is one of the most effective measures used to overcome addictions, but this isn't the only place this applies. The Lord has organized church houses and temples so that there are special environments in which we can dedicate time to learn and to make covenants. General authorities have stated repeatedly that our home is a place that should be comparable to the temple - it's a place we are at frequently. Mastering where we go is a part of choosing the right.

    Going is for when you need to leave something behind for something better.

2. **Doing**. The second verse of this hymn says "I'll say what you want me to say", but I opt for the verb "to do" because this is, in effect, what it describes. When it comes to the gospel, opening one's mouth - preaching - when called by the Lord to do so is a powerful way to help others to live it. It is actually [a way that the teacher and the student learn together](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.22?lang=eng#21). But our callings may not necessarily be to teach a large body of students. What we may need to do is can range from providing for our families, donating tithing, playing the piano, studying the scriptures, writing an emergency preparedness plan...I wouldn't be able to list them all here. These things are doing. These things are an important pattern in choosing the right: working so that the commandments of God are fulfilled.

    Connected to those commandments are also another element, which is obeying simply because it has been asked of you. [Christ did this when He realized the Atonement](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/22.41-42?lang=eng#40)- where He needed to fulfill His role simply by obeying the Lord's will, He did.

    Doing is for when you need to prove that you will be faithful in everything that the Lord asks of you.

3. **Being**. Being is for where a change in our external conditions - where we would *go* - and the strength we gain from obedience - what we would *do* - would not be sufficient by themselves to bring us where Heavenly Father wants us to be. Internal changes are necessary for the next step in God's plan for you. It's the deepest sacrifice to be made. The end result of the Plan of Salvation is to become more like Heavenly Father and His Son. This is necessary for us to become worthy of greater blessings, and greater capacity to choose the right. The Savior was the perfect example of *being* in His divine role. His role was not adequate for His character, but the other way around: He received His role as our Savior in the premortal life *because* of His character, and because of who He was already.

    Being is what Heavenly Father always intended for you in the end.

##Conclusion: Excited for 2015!

There are so many other things I've learned this last year, and I hope that as time goes on I will only be able to share more of them with you. I'm grateful for you loyal readers, and for you missionaries who always make writing these posts worthwhile. I have become a different, better person because of your influence, which passes on to me what Heavenly Father wants me to be. I don't know what He will need me to be for 2015, and what changes also await me...but I'm sure that they will be for my good, and so that I will be able to serve better and to love Him in greater degree.

I'm looking forward to it. :)
