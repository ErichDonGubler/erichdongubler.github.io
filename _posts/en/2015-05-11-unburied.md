Hey all!

Life's been a big mess of being buried! I just finished some of the coolest classes offered at UVU, and I'm glad to have been able to do them. I still think that in the long run, it's better to have the time to reflect and to be able to write y'all and keep you updated. Let me tell you why.

I've learned a lot about my limits, and where they are in terms of time. Most of what I've been able to do effectively since the year started is done because I dedicated the time necessary to do it. I was able to get the grades I wanted because I basically treated school with a time commitment a little greater than a full-time job. I've learned a lot about doing the balancing act of taking care of my body, mind, and spirit...though I need to start doing better, now that my schedule can shift a bit. 

One thing I've learned about recently is spiritual sight.

as a computer scientist, my primary method of communication is sight. My eyesight is probably the one sense I cannot do without in my profession. when a class is taught, a whiteboard and a projector are the most common tools for teaching. In the field, the primary means of expressing methods of computation to a computer (and to a human) is a text editor. the content of the Internet is primarily visual. There's simply no way to get around the fact that most of what I do is done by and through information interpreted through my eyes.

It's interesting to compare physical eyesight with spiritual eyesight. There's a lot of things that are similar. While physical eyesight is a powerful tool given freely at birth, the development of spiritual eyesight is one of the end goals of this life given to us by Heavenly Father. In the *Guide to the Scriptures*, which I find altogether underused in the Church, [the entry for "eye"](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/eye-eyes?lang=eng&letter=o) is as follows:

> In the scriptures, the eye is often used as a symbol of a person’s ability to receive the light of God. Symbolically, a person’s eye also shows spiritual condition and an understanding of the things of God.

If I don't take care of my physical eyes, at best they become strained and tired. If I'm doing what I should, I always take the time to refocus them, and if necessary I put some eye drops I buy occasionally for them. No matter how urgent my task is, my eyes will only do well if I give them sufficient care. I can't miss sleep or spend an entire day staring at a bright screen without resting and [expect to be fine](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.27?lang=eng#26) the next day. I may even be able to repeat several days' worth of work stressing my eyes without really taking care of them, but eventually they run out of strength without renewal...and then I simply won't function the way I should. And then I really am in trouble.

For me, it's always been the same with spiritual things. I **have** to take the time to renew myself spiritually, which not only includes refreshing my spiritual eyes with scriptures and prayer, but also resting adequately from the strains I place on my spirit every day. I have to take the time to filter out the artificial light that surrounds me in my day-to-day, and let my spiritual eyes recover. I've found that the best way for me to rest my spiritual eyes is by reflection and writing. I feel this relief in greatest measure when I read the Book of Mormon, and think specifically on relating its account to my own life -- be it for an hour, or only 15 minutes. The reading refreshes my spiritual eyes noticeably. My day simply isn't the same if I don't read that Book of Mormon. I love to combine it with renewing my baptismal covenant in church with the sacrament, which literally cleans my spirit. It helps me to [connect with the Savior](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.67-68?lang=eng#66) so much, and to remove any spiritual grit or dirt in my spiritual eyes. When I take the time to do these things, I feel so much more capable, and that I'm spending my efforts in places that are worthwhile. It helps me to see spiritually, and to stay healthy and strong in all aspects -- not just spiritual ones. I feel a physical and a mental effect when I neglect my spiritual eyes.

I know without a shadow of a doubt that the Book of Mormon and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints are gifts from a loving Heavenly Father in our age to indicate how He loves us, and how to take care of our own spiritual eyes in a way that is otherwise impossible. It's the only true and living Church on this Earth. If you've any doubts about that, I challenge you to [put the words of the Book of Mormon to the test](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm?lang=eng). God will help you to have the same conviction I have -- after all, He's the one who gave me the strength of conviction and belief that I have!

I love y'all! read the Book of Mormon! Study it, and it'll benefit you more than any other writing. Pray about it daily. And as always, let me know how you're doing! Don't forget to write!

Your loving friend,
