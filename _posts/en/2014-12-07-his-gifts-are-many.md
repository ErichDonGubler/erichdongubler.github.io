Not much has come to mind as I have thought on this weekly post, which is strange - usually I have to think about what I must *omit* when I write a post.

There are a few things, however, that I believe I can share. First is the new ["He Is the Gift"](http://www.mormon.org/christmas) initiative by the LDS Church, which my mother shared with me and I thought wonderful:

I think part of the reason people feel so willing to think about yearly resolutions and goals after Christmas is because Christ's spirit touches us, and renews our perspective of what is important. He enlarges our vision for the future. The spiritual man [considers his ways](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/hag/1.5-7?lang=eng#4), and seeks to leave behind that which he feels impedes his progress. Our spirits instinctively know how to distinguish the bad from the good, and those from the best! There was a wonderful quote by [Larry M. Gibbons in the October 2006 General Conference](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2006/10/wherefore-settle-this-in-your-hearts.p24-p25?lang=eng#p23):


> Now, young men and young women, as you begin to set your priorities in life, remember, the only true security in life is living the commandments. Financial security and public position are hollow without righteousness. I promise you that.
> 
> You lived with your Heavenly Father in a premortal life. You were there with Him. Your spirit knows what it is like to live in celestial realms. You can never be truly happy in an uncelestial environment. You know too much. That is one of the reasons that for you, wickedness never can be happiness. What a great thing it is to decide once and for all early in life what you will do and what you will not do with regards to honesty, modesty, chastity, the Word of Wisdom, and temple marriage.


I feel very strongly that this applies to all people. The [Spirit serves as a reminder](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.25-26?lang=eng#24) of this to us! The Spirit tells us what it was like to be with Heavenly Father, but we already know it to begin with - we'd just agreed to have that information darkened to our minds so that we could live by faith! What does **that** tell you about faith versus knowledge?

Anyway, those are my thoughts for now. I look forward to hearing back from you in your correspondences! It's a joy to hear from you always.
